            "Berserk" is a dark fantasy manga series written and illustrated by Kentaro Miura. The series began serialization in 1989 in "Monthly Animal House" magazine before moving to "Young Animal" in 1992. Unfortunately, Kentaro Miura passed away in May 2021, leaving the series unfinished.
            The story follows the life of Guts, a lone mercenary with a tragic past, as he battles his way through a dark and brutal medieval world filled with demons, supernatural forces, and political intrigue. Guts wields a massive sword known as the Dragonslayer and is marked with a cursed brand that attracts evil spirits and demons.
            The narrative explores themes of betrayal, revenge, the struggle between good and evil, and the consequences of one's choices. The series is known for its intense and visceral depictions of violence and horror, as well as its complex characters and intricate world-building.
            The "Berserk" manga gained widespread acclaim for its mature themes, intricate storytelling, and Miura's detailed artwork. The anime adaptations, however, have been more limited. There was a 25-episode anime adaptation that aired in 1997, covering a portion of the manga's storyline, and three Golden Age Arc films released between 2012 and 2013. The 2016-2017 anime adaptation, titled "Berserk (2016)," continued the story from the Golden Age Arc films but received mixed reviews, largely due to its use of CGI animation.
            Despite its dark and mature content, "Berserk" has garnered a dedicated fanbase and is often praised for its deep and thought-provoking narrative. The series has influenced many other works in the fantasy genre and remains a significant part of manga and anime culture.</p>
