        <h2>World of Berserk</h2>
        <p>
            The world of "Berserk" is a dark and medieval-inspired fantasy setting, filled with supernatural elements, political intrigue, and existential themes. Here are some key aspects of the world in which the story unfolds:
            Midland: Midland is a kingdom in the world of "Berserk" and serves as a central location for much of the series. It is a land of war and political conflict, and the story begins with the Band of the Hawk, a mercenary group led by Griffith, fighting in the Hundred-Year War.
            God Hand: The God Hand is a group of immensely powerful and demonic beings that play a significant role in the overarching narrative. They manipulate the course of destiny and are responsible for many of the supernatural events in the story.
            Apostles: Apostles are beings who have sacrificed their humanity to gain incredible power, often by making deals with the God Hand. They serve as the main antagonists in the series and are often monstrous in appearance.
            The Eclipse: A pivotal event in the series, the Eclipse marks a turning point for the main characters, particularly Guts and Griffith. It is a nightmarish ceremony orchestrated by the God Hand that has profound and lasting consequences.
            Brand of Sacrifice: Characters marked with the Brand of Sacrifice are destined to attract demonic entities, known as spirits or astral beings. Guts and Casca both bear this brand, leading to constant danger and harassment from supernatural forces.
            Interstice: The world of "Berserk" is divided into the Physical World and the Astral World. The Interstice is the realm between these two worlds, where supernatural entities can interact with the physical world. The Brand of Sacrifice makes individuals more susceptible to encounters with astral beings in this space.
            Magic and Witches: Magic is a significant element in the "Berserk" world. Witches, such as Schierke, possess powerful magical abilities and serve as important allies to Guts and his party. Magic is often used to combat the demonic forces that threaten the world.
            Skull Knight's Realm: The Skull Knight, a mysterious and powerful character, exists in a realm outside the bounds of normal time and space. He often appears to offer guidance or assistance to Guts and his party.
            The world of "Berserk" is grim, with themes of betrayal, sacrifice, and the struggle for survival permeating every aspect of the narrative. Kentaro Miura's detailed and atmospheric art contributes to the dark and foreboding atmosphere of the series, creating a unique and memorable world for readers and viewers alike.</p>
